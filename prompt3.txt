things that are not working:
1) when admin wants to permanently delete a doctor, despite pressing yes and the application 
confirming that it has been deleted, the permanent delete and restore buttons are still coming. 
It shouldnt come once permanently deleted
2) when admin wants to permanently delete a patient, it is failing to fetch the deleted Patients
3) the total deleted records is not adding up in the admin dashboard under "deleted records".
It is coming as 0.
